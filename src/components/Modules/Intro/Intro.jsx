        Event logs are a type of log entry in the Ethereum blockchain that
        contains information about events that have been triggered by smart
        contracts. Event logs are created when a contract emits an event in
        Solidity.

      <div className={styles.section}>Solidity CALLDATA tools</div>
      <div className={styles.description}>
        In Solidity, CALLDATA refers to the input data that is sent along with a
        function call to a contract on the Ethereum blockchain. When you invoke
        a function on a smart contract, you can provide arguments or parameters
        to that function. These arguments, along with information about the
        function being called, are encoded into a hexadecimal string known as
        the CALLDATA, and it is included in the transaction that invokes the
        function.

      <div className={styles.description}>
        A smart contract is a self-executing digital contract with the terms of
        the agreement directly written into code. It runs on a blockchain
        platform, most commonly associated with the Ethereum blockchain, but
        also present in other blockchain networks like Binance Smart Chain,
        Cardano, and more. The term "smart contract" was first coined by
        computer scientist and legal scholar Nick Szabo in 1994.
